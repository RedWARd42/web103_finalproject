## Draft User Stories

1. As a Borrower, I want to create a post detailing the item I need, so that I can find someone willing to lend it to me.
2. As a Lender, I want to create a post offering an item or service, so that I can help others in my community.
3. As a Borrower, I want to search for posts by keywords or tags, so that I can quickly find what I need.
4. As a Lender, I want to filter (and be able to filter by user and their currently open posts) posts by category, so that I can find Borrowers who need items I can provide.
5. As a Borrower, I want to view the profile of a Lender, so that I can check their rating and credibility before borrowing.
6. As a Lender, I want to view the profile of a Borrower, so that I can check their rating and credibility before lending.
7. As a Borrower, I want to leave a rating for a Lender after borrowing an item, so that I can help build their credibility. (Optional)
8. As a Borrower, I wish to send a request to a Lender, so that I can coordinate the borrowing process.
9. As a Lender, I want to accept or reject a request from a Borrower, so that I can manage my lending activities. After accepting, I want to mark the item as unavaliable and send the Borrower my contact information.
10. As a Borrower or Lender, I want to be able to follow specific users, so that I can stay updated on their posts and activities.
