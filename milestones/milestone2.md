## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a productive meeting to discuss the ERDs of the project and brainstorm the different wireframes for the project. We also communicated any questions and conerns well. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Many of us had midterms this week, so it was a little hard to find a good time meet up. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We might need help with the technical implementation to make sure the web app can acess multiple tables.
