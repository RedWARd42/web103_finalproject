## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Communication is going well in this unit. We were able to meet up and make sure we all understood the assignment this week and we were able to coordinate the tasks each of us had to do. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had a small issue in setting up the milestone but it was resolved quickly.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we were able to finish the tasks in our plan this week. We didn't complete any features from the read me because we were just focusing on setting up the database and the backend of the project for this week. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think the matchmacking feature is 'at risk' because we need to make sure more basic features are functioning before implementing this feature. We will change the plan and make the matchmaking feature into a stretch feature because it is not necessary to have in the MVP version of the web app. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

 We might need help with the technical implementation to make sure the web app can acess multiple tables.
